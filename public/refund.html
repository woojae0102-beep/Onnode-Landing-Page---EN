        <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
        <p class="updated">Last Updated: February 4, 2025</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Important:</strong> This refund policy has been prepared in accordance with the Act on Consumer Protection in Electronic Commerce, considering the characteristics of digital services.
        </div>

        <h2>Article 1 (Overview of Refund Policy)</h2>
        <p>OnNode prioritizes customer satisfaction and operates a fair and transparent refund policy. While there may be some limitations due to the nature of digital content and services, we actively process refunds when there are legitimate reasons.</p>
        <p>All payments, billing, subscription management, and refunds are processed and managed by Paddle.com Market Limited (“Paddle”), who acts as the Merchant of Record for all transactions. 

           Refund eligibility, processing procedures, and timelines are determined in accordance with Paddle’s policies and applicable consumer protection laws. The Company does not directly process payments or store full payment details.</p>

        <h2>Article 2 (Refundable Conditions)</h2>
        
        <h3>2.1 Full Refund Available (Within 7 days from purchase date)</h3>
        <p>Full refunds are available in the following cases:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When the service has not been used at all</li>
            <li>When service use was impossible due to system errors</li>
            <li>When the actual service significantly differs from advertised content</li>
            <li>When service provision is impossible due to the company's fault</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.2 Subscription Refunds</h3>
        <p>
        Refund eligibility for subscriptions, including any partial or prorated refunds,
        is determined solely in accordance with Paddle’s refund policy and applicable
        consumer protection laws. The Company does not independently calculate or
        guarantee prorated refunds.</p>

        <h3>2.3 Refund Restrictions</h3>
        <p>Refunds may be restricted in the following cases:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When AI analysis reports have already been received (due to digital content characteristics)</li>
            <li>When requesting a refund due to simple change of mind after using the service for 7 days or more</li>
            <li>When service use is impossible due to customer's fault</li>
            <li>Discounted amounts from events or promotions</li>
            <li>When there is a record of digital services already provided and used after payment completion, refunds may be restricted in accordance with relevant laws</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Where permitted by applicable law, users acknowledge that access to digital services or generated AI reports may begin immediately after purchase, and in such cases the right of withdrawal or refund may be limited.</p>

        <h2>Article 3 (Plan-Specific Notes)</h2>
        <p>
        The descriptions of individual products or subscription plans are provided for
        informational purposes only. Any eligibility for refunds, partial refunds, or
        billing adjustments related to specific plans is determined solely by Paddle in
        accordance with their policies and applicable consumer protection laws.
        </p>
        

        <h2>Article 4 (Subscription Cancellation and Refund)</h2>
        
        <h3>4.1 Subscription Cancellation</h3>
        <p>Subscription payments are processed as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can cancel your subscription at any time before the next billing cycle</li>
            <li>When canceling a subscription, you can use the service until the current billing cycle ends</li>
            <li>After cancellation, the next payment will not be automatically charged</li>
            <li>Subscription cancellation can be requested at any time via customer service email and will be available through My Page in the future</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Subscription cancellation stops future billing only and does not automatically entitle the user to a refund for the current billing period unless required by applicable law or Paddle’s refund policy.</p>

        <h3>4.2 Mid-subscription Cancellation</h3>
        <p>When canceling mid-subscription:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If a subscription is canceled during an active billing period, refunds are not guaranteed and are subject to Paddle’s refund policy and applicable consumer protection laws.</li>
            <li>However, if a substantial portion of the service has already been used, the refund amount may be small</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Article 5 (Service Errors and Billing Issues)</h2>
        <p>If service disruption or system errors occur, users may contact customer support.
           Any refunds, billing adjustments, or compensation related to such issues will be
           handled by Paddle in accordance with their policies and applicable laws.</p>
